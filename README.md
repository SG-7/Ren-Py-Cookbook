# Ren-Py-Cookbook

I made this from an old script.rpy of a game I was working on. It had a lot of code that was good at the time and I don't remember if I made it or found it somewhere.

I'd like to keep this as a cookbook for any future projects made in the Ren'Py engine. I made this repo public so anyone who finds it can add to it and we might be able to help each other.

I'm sure this all seems like small potatoes to experienced programmers, but I feel like I'm starting from zero again and would like to have a point of reference that I can come back to.

I edited some lines to make it more generic and added comments to make everything easier to understand.
