# Ren-Py-Cookbook

I made this from an old script.rpy of a game I was working on. It had a lot of code that was good at the time and I don't remember if I made it or found it somewhere.
I'd like to keep this as a cookbook for any future projects made in the Ren'Py engine. I made this repo public so anyone who finds it can add to it and we might be able to help each other.
